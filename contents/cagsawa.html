                    <p>Brief description of Cagsawa Ruins (what it is today).
                        The Cagsawa Ruins (also spelled as Kagsawa, historically spelled as Cagsaua) are the remnants of
                        a 16th-century Franciscan church, the Cagsawa church. It was originally built in the town of
                        Cagsawa in 1587 but was burned down and destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1636. It was rebuilt in
                        1724 by Fr. Francisco Blanco but was destroyed again, along with the town of Cagsawa, on
                        February 1, 1814, during the eruption of Mayon Volcano.
                    </p>
                    <p>The ruins are currently located in Barangay Busay, Cagsawa, in the municipality of Daraga, Albay,
                        Philippines. It is part of Cagsawa Park, is protected and maintained by the municipal government
                        of Daraga and the National Museum of the Philippines, and is one of the most popular tourist
                        destinations in the area. The Internationale Tourismus-Börse Berlin, one of the world's top
                        travel trade shows based in Berlin, has even recognized the site as one of the places to visit
                        in Asia. A preliminary excavation of the Cagsawa ruins by the Bulacan State University, show
                        that the Spanish incorporated Mesoamerican influences in constructing the complex. </p>
                        
                    <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>
                    <p>1616 Eruption – Mayon’s first recorded eruption occurred in 1616, spewing ash and lava. Spanish
                        colonizers documented the event, marking the beginning of its historical volcanic activity. The
                        eruption caused significant damage to nearby settlements. It set the precedent for future
                        evacuations and disaster responses.</p>
                    <p>1814 Eruption – One of Mayon’s deadliest eruptions buried the town of Cagsawa, killing over 1,200
                        people. Only the bell tower of Cagsawa Church remains visible today as a grim reminder. The
                        eruption also destroyed several other villages. Ashfall reached as far as present-day Legazpi
                        City.</p>
                    <p>1897 Eruption – This violent eruption lasted for seven days, with lava flows reaching the lower
                        slopes. It caused massive evacuations and economic disruption. The event was one of the most
                        visually documented eruptions of the 19th century. It reinforced Mayon’s reputation as both
                        beautiful and deadly.</p>
                    <p>1984 Eruption – A major eruption prompted the evacuation of over 73,000 people. Lava fountains
                        and pyroclastic flows devastated nearby farmlands. The Philippine government and international
                        agencies closely monitored the event. Despite the destruction, no fatalities were recorded due
                        to effective disaster response.</p>
                    <p>2018 Eruption – A phreatic (steam-driven) eruption led to ash plumes rising kilometers into the
                        sky. Thousands were evacuated as lava flows and pyroclastic density currents threatened
                        communities. The eruption lasted several months, disrupting flights and agriculture. It
                        highlighted the need for constant volcanic monitoring and preparedness.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Facts</h2>
                    <p>Mayon’s near-perfect conical shape is the result of its stratovolcano structure, built up by
                        layers of hardened lava, ash, and volcanic rocks from past eruptions. Unlike other volcanoes
                        that may have irregular shapes due to explosive eruptions or landslides, Mayon’s eruptions
                        typically produce viscous lava that flows symmetrically down its slopes. This consistent
                        eruptive behavior over centuries has maintained its iconic form.</p>
                    <p>Scientists study Mayon’s eruptions to understand volcanic behavior better. Its frequent activity
                        provides valuable data on magma movement, gas emissions, and pyroclastic flows. Despite its
                        beauty, the volcano remains highly dangerous, with lahars (mudflows) and pyroclastic surges
                        posing constant threats. Advanced monitoring systems, including seismographs and satellite
                        imaging, help predict eruptions and save lives.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Folklore & Local Legnecs</h2>
                    <p>The Legend of Daragang Magayon – The most famous legend tells of the beautiful princess Magayon
                        (meaning "beautiful" in Bicolano) who fell in love with a warrior named Panganoron. Their tragic
                        love story ended in death, and it is said that Mayon grew from Magayon’s grave, with Panganoron
                        as the clouds that often shroud the peak.</p>
                    <p>The Fire of Gugurang – Ancient Bicolanos believed that the volcano was the home of Gugurang,
                        their supreme god who controlled fire and punished the wicked. Eruptions were seen as his wrath
                        against immoral acts.</p>
                    <p> The Battle of Gods – Another myth tells of a conflict between Gugurang and his rival, Asuang
                        (the god of evil). Asuang’s attempts to steal Gugurang’s fire caused eruptions and earthquakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Guardian Spirits – Locals believe that ancestral spirits dwell within Mayon, protecting the
                        land. Offerings are sometimes made to appease them and prevent eruptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>The White Rock (Lignon Hill) – A legend says that a giant white rock near Mayon was a piece of
                        the volcano thrown during a battle between gods, now serving as a natural landmark.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Lancmarks (Tourist Spots)</h2>
                    <p> Cagsawa Ruins – The remains of an 18th-century church buried by the 1814 eruption, now a famous
                        tourist spot and photography site.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lignon Hill – A viewpoint offering panoramic views of Mayon and Legazpi City, with a zipline
                        adventure for thrill-seekers.
                    </p>

                        the volcano’s summit.</p>
                    <p>Quitinday Green Hills Formation – Rolling hills resembling Bohol’s Chocolate Hills, with a
                        stunning Mayon backdrop.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Mayon Volcano is more than just a natural wonder—it is the heart of
                        Bicolano culture, history, and identity. Its eruptions have shaped the land and the resilience
                        of the people, while its beauty inspires art, literature, and pride. The volcano’s presence is
                        intertwined with local spirituality, as seen in myths and rituals that honor its power.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">For Bicolanos, Mayon symbolizes both danger and majesty, reminding
                        them of nature’s unpredictability and their ability to adapt. Festivals like the Magayon
                        Festival celebrate this connection, blending tradition with modern appreciation. Whether as a
                        scientific marvel, a tourist attraction, or a cultural icon, Mayon remains an enduring symbol of
                        the Bicol Region’s strength and beauty.
